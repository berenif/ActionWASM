# Demo Fix Summary

## Issue: Demo Stops After a Few Seconds

### Problems Identified

1. **Missing Error Handling**: The demo JavaScript code lacked proper error handling for DOM element access, which could cause the animation loops to crash silently.

2. **Port Conflict**: The WebSocket configuration was set to use port 8080, which conflicts with the HTTP server also running on port 8080.

3. **Unhandled Exceptions**: No global error handlers were in place to catch and report JavaScript errors.

4. **Synchronization Issues**: The performance counter synchronization code in the HTML could fail if elements weren't found.

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in demo.js
- Added try-catch blocks around performance monitoring functions
- Added null checks for DOM elements before accessing them
- Added console logging for debugging
- Added global error and unhandled rejection handlers

#### 2. Fixed Port Configuration
- Changed WebSocket port from 8080 to 8081 to avoid conflict with HTTP server
- This prevents connection attempts to the wrong service

#### 3. Improved Counter Synchronization
- Added error handling to the setInterval that syncs performance counters
- Automatically stops the interval if required elements are missing
- Prevents infinite error loops

#### 4. Added Debug Tools
- Created `test-demo-monitor.html` for real-time monitoring
- Created `test-demo-debug.html` for iframe-based testing

## How to Test the Demo

### Option 1: Basic Test
```bash
# The HTTP server should already be running on port 8080
# If not, run:
python3 -m http.server 8080 &

# Open in browser:
http://localhost:8080/demo.html
```

### Option 2: With Monitoring
```bash
# Open the monitor page to see real-time diagnostics:
http://localhost:8080/test-demo-monitor.html

# Click "Load Demo" to start monitoring
# Watch the console output for any errors
```

### Option 3: Check Console
1. Open the demo at http://localhost:8080/demo.html
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Check the Console tab for debug messages:
   - "Demo initialization started"
   - "Performance monitoring started"
   - "Metrics monitoring started"
   - "Canvas initialized with dimensions: [width]x[height]"
   - "Demo initialization completed successfully"
   - Regular metric updates every 2 seconds

## What to Expect

### Normal Operation
- The demo should load and display a gradient background
- Performance counters (FPS, Latency, Memory, Entities) should update
- The canvas should show "Game Canvas - Click buttons to see features in action"
- Console should show periodic metric updates
- No errors in the browser console

### If Issues Persist
Check for:
1. **Canvas not found**: Ensure the demo-canvas element exists
2. **Counter elements missing**: Check if fps-counter, latency-counter, etc. exist
3. **JavaScript errors**: Look for red error messages in console
4. **Network errors**: Check if any resources fail to load

## Additional Notes

- The demo runs entirely in the browser and doesn't require a game server
- The WebSocket configuration is for future multiplayer features
- The signaling server (port 8081) is optional for the demo
- Performance metrics are simulated for demonstration purposes
